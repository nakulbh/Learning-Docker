Hypervisor ---> virtualisation (virtual isolation) 
...............................................................
to make a vm we need a virtualisation platform and to create a container we also need a contanalisarion platform

most organisation use vm/EC2 instance and on top of them they use Docker 

containers are ligthweight in nature,
they dont have a complete os,
they share resourses from the host os,
they have a base image of a os or you can say a package which is combiantion of your app + lib + system dependicies,
they are easy to ship as their copy is low in size,
if you want to copy a vm you make a snapshot of it which is 1-2 gb and in containers it is just in mb's

vm have a complete os and hardware and everthing is seprate

command -> container -> Docker file -> submit this to docker engine -> this file is converted into a image -> now again with some commands we can convert this image into container
